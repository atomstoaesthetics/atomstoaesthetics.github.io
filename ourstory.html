            Hi everyone! We're Utsav and Sanjana, and we're so excited to share our story with you. Believe it or not, we've known each other since we were just 11 years old, back in our school days. Utsav, being the mischievous one, used to irritate Sanjana quite a bit. But there was something about her infectious smile and bubbly personality that he found irresistible.

            Even though we lost touch for a while after school, social media kept us loosely connected. It wasn't until early 2022 that a casual conversation rekindled our friendship. Soon, we were chatting day and night, discovering how much we had in common. It felt like fate had brought us back together. Utsav finally admitted that his childhood teasing was just a way to get Sanjana's attention!
            
            Our journey as a couple began at Canoe restaurant in Toronto, where we shared a memorable evening taking in the breathtaking views of the CN Tower. This marked the start of countless adventures, each one strengthening our bond. Utsav frequently visited Toronto while he was completing his PhD, and Sanjana treasured every opportunity to spend time with Utsav as we knew we found something special. We shared the news with our families and got engaged in May 2023 during a beautiful trip to India, where our parents met for the first time.
            
            For Utsav, Sanjana's radiant smile and genuine humility are what make her truly remarkable. Her smile has the power to lift his spirits, and her humility is the foundation of their strong partnership. As a couple, we complement each other beautifully. Utsav appreciates the scientific method and logical reasoning, while Sanjana has a strong intuition for creativity. This combination of qualities makes us better people and enriches our lives together. From that first date to our engagement, getting married was always on the horizon, and now, that time has finally come!
          </p>
          <!--p style="text-align: justify;">
            We are Utsav and Sanjana, and our journey began in the bustling hallways of our school when we were just 11 years old. Utsav, with his mischievous grin and playful pranks, couldn't help but tease Sanjana, drawn to her infectious laughter and radiant smile that lit up every room. Even then, he recognized something special in her.

            Sanjana, with her kind heart and easygoing nature, was always a joy to be around. Her genuine warmth and openness made her approachable, and her ability to find humor in any situation was incredibly endearing. Little did they know that their youthful interactions were laying the foundation for a deeper connection.
            
            After school, life's currents carried us in different directions, but thanks to the wonders of social media, we never truly lost touch. We watched each other's lives unfold through Instagram, sharing milestones and experiences from afar.
            
            Then, in early 2022, a simple message rekindled our connection. A casual conversation blossomed into hours-long chats, as we discovered a remarkable alignment in our thoughts, values, and dreams for the future. It was as if the years apart had only strengthened the bond that began in our childhood.
            
            Utsav, eager to see Sanjana again, made frequent trips to Toronto, where their first official date at the elegant Canoe restaurant solidified their feelings for each other. With each monthly visit, their love story unfolded, leading them on countless adventures together – from exploring bustling city streets to relaxing on tranquil beaches.
            
            In just over a year, their love blossomed into an engagement in May 2023, a joyous occasion filled with laughter, tears, and the heartwarming union of their families in India.
            
            For Utsav, Sanjana's smile is not just a physical feature but a reflection of her beautiful soul. Her humility, a rare and precious trait, is the cornerstone of their relationship, fostering a deep understanding and unwavering support for each other. Her ability to transform his mood with a single smile is a testament to the depth of their connection and the power of their love.
            
            From that very first date to their engagement, their path towards marriage was clear and undeniable. And now, the time has come for us to celebrate our love with all of you, our dearest family and friends.
